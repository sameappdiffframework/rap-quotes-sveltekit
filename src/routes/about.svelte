<h1>About Rap Quotes</h1>
<p>
  This is a hard-coded mock up for the <em>Same App, Different Framework</em> project.
  SADF aims to recreate the same app using different frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, etc, etc) in
  order to
  compare and learn each framework.
</p>

<p>
  Rap Quotes is the skeleton for that common app in the project.
  It was created here by hand just to work through all the desired CSS and
  HTML <em>before</em> attempting to
  recreate the concept in other frameworks.
</p>

<p>
  The app simply displays a select few of dope rap bars from various rappers.
  Nothing too fancy, but robust enough to serve as more than a simple Hello, World app.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
  In order to serve as a good app, this app aims to use the following features that are commonly seen
  during
  web app development.
</p>
